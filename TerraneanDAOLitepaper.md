Terranean DAO Litepaper
-----------------------

The Terranean Decentralized Autonomous Organization (Terranean DAO) is an initiative that aims to democratize the development of decentralized systems. Terran can play an important role by being a facilitator in the journey towards our common goals by increasing transparency and public involvement in the decision making process.

By giving more choice, independence and opportunity, Terranean DAO aims to help leaders, communities, entrepreneurs, investors and organizations who are setting out on journeys to build a decentralized future.

How will this be achieved? Terranean DAO will be leveraging blockchain based solutions that empower communities and organizations in a collective decision making role by utilizing governance tokens to exercise cooperative input and control over the treasury.Â 

### What is a DAO

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), is an organization that is represented by an organizational structure built on blockchain technology. A DAO has no central decision making authority, the governance decisions and financial transactions are maintained on a blockchain. [1]

Think of a DAO like an internet-native business that's collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice. [1]

There's no CEO who can authorize spending based on their own whims and no chance of a dodgy CFO manipulating the books. Everything is out in the open and the rules around spending are baked into the DAO via its code. [1]

### Terranean DAO Overview

Terranean DAO will be made up of two governing bodies, the DAO Committee and the DAO Community. The DAO Committee will be made up of organizations working on solutions that align with Terranean DAO's vision of decentralization and autonomy.

Terranean DAO will follow a share-based membership model. Those seeking membership must submit a proposal to join the DAO and deposit value in the form of tokens or work. The DAO Committee is responsible for protecting the interests of the DAO and decentralization of the governing power.
